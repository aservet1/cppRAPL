Using data structures and algorithms in C++ to gather/store/present/analyze
RAPL measurements.

Yooooo are there any c++ machine learning libraries that we could find a
way to use?

the RAPL library was taken from Rutvik and Alejandro's jRAPL project
and the files were edit to remove any java interface data types
or parameters, making them pure C functions that can be called in C++
